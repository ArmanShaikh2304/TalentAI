# 🚀 TalentAI – Hiring Beyond Keywords

<p align="center">
  <b>An Explainable Candidate Intelligence Platform that ranks candidates beyond keyword matching using Semantic Search, Vector Embeddings, and AI-powered Re-ranking.</b>
</p>

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely heavily on exact keyword matching, causing highly qualified candidates to be overlooked despite having relevant experience and transferable skills.

TalentAI solves this by understanding both:

* 📄 Job Requirements
* 👨‍💼 Candidate Profiles

and intelligently ranking candidates based on genuine fit rather than simple keyword overlap.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Job Description Understanding

* Extracts:

  * Required Skills
  * Experience Level
  * Domain Knowledge
  * Seniority Requirements
  * Behavioral Indicators

### 🔍 Semantic Candidate Search

* Finds relevant candidates beyond exact keyword matches.

### 📊 AI-Powered Re-ranking

Ranks candidates using:

* Semantic Similarity
* Experience Match
* Skill Coverage
* Career Progression
* Behavioral Signals

### 💡 Explainable AI

Provides reasons behind every recommendation.

Example:

```text
Candidate #1
✓ Strong cloud expertise
✓ 6 years of backend experience
✓ Leadership experience
✓ Similar domain projects
```

### ⚡ Fast Retrieval

Processes thousands of candidate profiles efficiently using vector search.
